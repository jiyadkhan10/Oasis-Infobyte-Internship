# Oasis Infobyte Internship
# Introduction
In order to achieve a successful completion of the Data Science internship, I will be tasked with the responsibility of completing five essential tasks. These tasks have been carefully designed to provide me with a comprehensive learning experience during my internship tenure. The successful fulfillment of these five tasks is pivotal in determining the overall success of my internship journey. Each of these assignments is crafted to enhance my skills and contribute to mu growth as a data scientist. As you embark on this internship, these five tasks will be my primary milestones towards a rewarding experience. <br/>

# Tasks
# Task 01 - Iris Flower Classification

Iris flower has three species; setosa, versicolor, and virginica, which differs according to their measurements. Now assume that you have the measurements of the iris flowers according to their species, and here your task is to train a machine learning model that can learn from the measurements of the iris species and classify them. <br/>
<br/>
Although the Scikit-learn library provides a dataset for iris flower classification, you can also download the same dataset from here for the task of iris flower classification with Machine Learning. <br/>

# Task 02 - Unemployment Analysis With Python

Unemployment is measured by the unemployment rate which is the number of people who are unemployed as a percentage of the total labour force. We have seen a sharp increase in the unemployment rate during Covid-19, so analyzing the unemployment rate can be a good data science project. <br/>

# Task 03 - Car Price Prediction With Machine Learning 

The price of a car depends on a lot of factors like the goodwill of the brand of the car, features of the car, horsepower and the mileage it gives and many more. Car price prediction is one of the major research areas in machine learning. So if you want to learn how to train a car price prediction model then this project is for you. <br/>

# Task 04 - Email Spam Detection With Machine Learning

We’ve all been the recipient of spam emails before. Spam mail, or junk mail, is a type of email that is sent to a massive number of users at one time, frequently containing cryptic messages, scams, or most dangerously, phishing content. <br/>
<br/>
In this Project, use Python to build an email spam detector. Then, use machine learning to train the spam detector to recognize and classify emails into spam and non-spam. <br/>

# Task 05 - Sales Prediction Using Python

Sales prediction means predicting how much of a product people will buy based on factors such as the amount you spend to advertise your product, the segment of people you advertise for, or the platform you are advertising on about your product. <br/>
<br/>
Typically, a product and service-based business always need their Data Scientist to predict their future sales with every step they take to manipulate the cost of advertising their product. So let’s start the task of sales prediction with machine learning using Python. <br/>
